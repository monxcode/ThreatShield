##  Overview

**Cyber Threat Detector (CyberRakshak)** is a browser-based, frontend-only security tool that analyzes suspicious **URLs** and **texts**.  
This tool detects common phishing, scam, and malicious **patterns using rule-based logic —** without any backend, API, or database.

This Project  main goal:
> **Cybersecurity awareness + interactive learning**, Specially for hackathons & demos.

##  Key Features

###  Threat Analysis
- URL analysis (phishing indicators)
- Text analysis (urgent / scammy language)
- Auto-extract URL from Text
- Same input → same output (consistent results)

###  Rule-Based Detection Engine
Detect karta hai:
- HTTP (non-secure) URLs  
- IP address as domain  
- URL shorteners (bit.ly etc.)  
- Suspicious TLDs (`.xyz`, `.top`, `.club`)  
- Blacklisted / fake domains  
- Multiple subdomains  
- `@` symbol misuse  
- Brand impersonation & typosquatting  
- Phishing keywords & urgency language  

### Visual Risk Output
- Animated **Risk Meter (0–10)**
- Threat levels:
  - `0–2 → Safe`
  - `3–5 → Suspicious`
  - `6–10 → Dangerous`
- Color-coded UI
- Chart.js based threat breakdown
- Clear reason list with icons

###  Gamification
- User security score (points)
- Progress bar system
- Badge unlocking:
  - First Scan
  - 10 Safe Scans
  - Threat Detective
  - Security Expert
- LocalStorage based (no login needed)

###  Personalized Safety Tips
- Threat ke according dynamic safety tips
- Easy-to-understand recommendations

###  UI / UX
- Glassmorphism + neon Gen-Z design
- Smooth animations
- Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
- Hackathon-ready visual polish

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure  
- **CSS3** – Glassmorphism, animations, responsiveness  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Rule-based threat logic  
- **Chart.js** – Threat visualization

##  How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. User URL ya text input karta hai  
2. System rules ke basis par multiple checks karta hai  
3. Har rule ek threat score add karta hai  
4. Final score se risk level decide hota hai  
5. UI me:
   - Risk meter update
   - Reasons show
   - Chart update
   - Safety tips generate
   - User score & badges update
